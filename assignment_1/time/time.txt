-O0 4s 536996565n 
// Fetches some loop variables from memory.

-O1 0s 187074773n
// Saves all loop variables in registers which results in less instructions
and fetching register values is faster than fetching memory values.

-O2 0s 404n
// The loop dissapears and the arithmetic sum is calculated at compile time.

-O3 0s 429n
// Same as -O2

-Os 0s 187082505n
// As -O1 since loops takes less size but storing the arithmetic sum is not
efficient since it actually stores the calculated.

-Og 0s 329046911n
// Fast compilation
